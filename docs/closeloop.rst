Closing the loop: improving your models from feedback
====================================



Improving your models
When the rasa_nlu server is running, it keeps track of all the predictions it's made and saves these to a log file. By default this is called ``rasa_nlu_log.json``
You can fix any incorrect predictions and add them to your training set to improve your parser.
